## Description
This is a project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a quiz game. The quiz is focused on JavaScript knowlege. You can test your understanding at https://josephdaw.github.io/code-quiz

### User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```


### Mock-Up

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:

## Lessons 
This has been my most involved project so far. There are a number of different concepts that have been required to get this application working.
### DOM Manipulation
This project relies heavily on manipulating the DOM in order to get the items to display as desired. After completing this project I would say that I am much more comfortable with this.
### Local Storage
This is one of the key components to this project. The user's initials and score is stored in local storage on submit. This allows for the top 5 scores to be presented to the user on the high scores page. 
### Objects
In order to get the functionality I wanted, I used a number of arrays that contained objects. The questions and answers are stored that way, as is the user's initials and scores. This took me a while to work out how to properly implement.
