## Lessons 
This has been my most challenging project so far. There are a number of different concepts that have been required to get this application working.

## Credits
- This user story is part of the [Adelaide University Coding Boot Camp](https://bootcamps.adelaide.edu.au).
- I used the YouTube video [Build a Quiz App with JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k) to help me get my head around some of the concepts.
